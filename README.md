# Welcome to my simple TextBasedGame

## Goal
The goal was to write a command line based role playing game.

## General comments
* I didn't really have much to do this, so there are still many things to be improved
* once the project gets evaluated I'll refactor this to be more developer-friendly.
* test coverage is not nearly sufficient, but this is how it looks if you have only a couple of hours for a project.

## Running
### IDE
just run `main` method in `com.company.cli.Main` class

JAR
------------------
```
java -jar TextBasedGame.jar
```
